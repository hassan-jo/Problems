Watermelon
Problem Description

One hot summer day, Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that, the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos.

They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the watermelon. However, they faced a problem:

Pete and Billy are fans of even numbers. They want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs an even number of kilos. It is not required that the parts are equal. Both parts must be of positive weight.

Your task is to help them find out if it is possible to divide the watermelon in the way they want.

Input

The first (and only) line contains an integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output

Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each weighing an even number of kilos.

Otherwise, print NO.

Example
Input
8

Output
YES


Explanation:
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos, or 4 and 4 kilos.

Notes

The weight of each part must be positive.

The solution only depends on the weight being even and greater than 2.
